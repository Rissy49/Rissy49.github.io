<h2>Hisory - During the Curse</h2>
<p>Henry is born in a prison in Phoenix, Arizona, and given up for adoption by his birth mother, Emma, because she wishes to give him his best chance in lifeAfter being given up by Emma, he is placed with</br>
his first family, but for an unknown reason, it doesn't work out. He is put up for adoption again in Boston, where Regina adopts him, and she names him Henry after her father. Upon bringing him back to</br>
Storybrooke with her, Regina finds Henry is very fussy and difficult to calm down. She attempts to tell him a bedtime story, but he suddenly vomits on her shirt. A thorough check by Dr. Whale at the</br>
hospital proves Henry is healthy, but he suggests looking into the birth parents' medical records for genetic diseases. While Regina talks with Sidney on the phone about looking up the information, she</br>
hands her son to a hospital volunteer, Mary Margaret, who instinctively begins rocking and soothing him. Stunned that Henry has finally quieted down, she takes him back into her own arms, to which he starts</br>
to cry again, leading her to believe there is something wrong with her as a mother. When Regina, at last, manages to help Henry relax, she learns from Sidney about her child's birth mother, who was abandoned</br>
in the woods eighteen years ago, causing her to suspect this is the grown-up savior of the curse. Since Mr. Gold was the one who procured Henry for her, Regina confronts him about orchestrating everything,</br>
but he chalks up her erratic behavior to being a full-time mom. She return Henry to Boston, where he will be given to the next potential family. As Regina says goodbye to him, she realizes that she loves</br>
Henry, despite who his birth mother is, and decides to keep him. In fear that the savior will come to reclaim Henry one day, Regina decides to erase her own knowledge of Henry's birth mother. While Henry is</br>
resting in a crib, she brings him to her vault. She tells him a story of a queen and her prince as she makes and then drinks a potion to help herself forget about his birth mother</p>

<h2>History - After the Curse</h2>
<p>Shortly after the purple smoke clears, Emma reunites with Mary Margaret and David after the curse has been broken. She pulls back after the tender moment and states to her allies, including Granny, Ruby,</br>
Mother Superior and the seven dwarves, have to find Mr. Gold and ask him what he did to Storybrooke by releasing the purple smoke. As they walk towards the pawn shop, her parents attempt to get Emma to</br> 
open up to them. Emma is still reeling from finding out who they are and asks for time to adjust. Suddenly, Archie rushes up to inform them that Dr. Whale is leading an angry mob to Regina's house. Prompted</br>
by Henry's concern for Regina, they make it in time to stop Dr. Whale. With her parents, they decide to place Regina in a jail cell for protection and then confront Mr. Gold for his misdeeds. Mr. Gold believes</br>
that he deserves thanks for bringing Emma to her parents, breaking the curse and saving Henry's life, which she is doubtful he has any credit in. Instead, they learn Mr. Gold released a Wraith upon town to</br>
destroy Regina. They temporarily stop the creature, but Regina has a more permanent solution by using a hat to send it away. About the time when the Wraith causes destruction in Storybrooke, Emma drives her 
car to somewhere and almost bumps into a man. At town hall, Regina's attempt at opening a vortex fails until Emma grabs her hand and unintentionally activates the hat. Emma pushes Regina out of the way when
the Wraith moves to grab her. As the Wraith falls into the vortex, Emma is drawn in, to which Mary Margaret follows through. The two women land in the Enchanted Forest and are found by Auroraand Mulan.</p>
