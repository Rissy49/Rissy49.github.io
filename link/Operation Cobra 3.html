To put an end in our misery. Today we claim victory. And move to a new better realm.</br>
A place where we can finally win."</br>

The witch with no eyes asks, "and we'll be happy?"</br>

The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">evil queen</a> responds, "I guarantee it."
She continutes and says," But first I need something from you."</br>

"A lock of hair from those with the darkest souls."</br>
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">evil queen</a> then says, "You must trust me, because if you dont...there are other ways."</br>
