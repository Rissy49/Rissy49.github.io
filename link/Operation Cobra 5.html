</br>

<center><p>Her father Henry asks, "Did <a href="Operation Cobra Rumpelstiltskin.html">Rumpelstiltskin</a> tell you everything you needed to know?"
</br>

The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> responded, "Yes." Her father responds."And?"
</br>

She continues and says, "I'm not sure I should say...I'm conflicted."
</br>

</br>
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> responds, "I have to cut out the heart of the thing I love the most."
</br>

Her father responds, "me."
</br>

*Then the <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> turns around to her father and says, "daddy, I don't know what to do?"
</br>

Her father responds, "My dear, please, you don'y have to do this."
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> repsons, "I have to do something!"
</br>

Her father then says, "Then move past this. I know this may sound self serving, you don't need to enact the curse."
</br>

Then the <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> quickly responded, "But I can't keep living like this!
</br>
What <a href="Operation Cobra Snow.html">Snow</a> did to me, took from me. It's eating me alive daddy.
</br>
Her very exsistence mocks me. She must be punished."
</br>

</br>
Then her father says, "If the price is a hole, that would never be filled, then why do it?
</br> 
Stop worrying about <a href="Operation Cobra Snow.html">Snow White</a> and start over. We can have a new life.
</br>

Then the <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> quickly respons, "What kind of life? All I've worked for, all I've built will be gone.
</br>
My power will disappear. They already think I'm nothing.
</br>

Then her father says, "Power is seductive, but so is love. You can have that again.
</br>

The two hug, and the <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> says, "I just want to be happy." while crying.
</br>

Her father respons, "You can be. There's some sure. I believe if given the chance, we can find happiness together...but the choice is yours."

</br>
Then the <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> says, "I think you're right. I can be happy... just not here."
</br>

*Then she pulls out her fathers heart and the father drops to the ground and dies."
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> whispers, "sorry."
