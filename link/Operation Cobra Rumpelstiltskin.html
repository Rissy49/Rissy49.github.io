<h2>History - Before the Curse</h2>
<p>During a dark winter, Fiona with her husband Malcolm at her side gives birth to a son. Shortly after his birth, the Blue Fairy and Tiger Lily, the newborn's fairy godmother, visit to deliver a prophecy</br>
about the child's destiny to become the Savior and die fighting a great evil. After Fiona becomes obsessed with changing her child's destiny, she transforms herself into a Fairy to protect her son. Fiona</br>
takes the infant with her as she searches for the great evil prophesied to be born the same winter. Fiona and Tiger Lily are unable to find the great evil and take the child to the sacred fairy vault.</br>
Eventually, Tiger Lily wants to stop Fiona, when she realizes the latter wants to cast a dark curse. Fiona takes the fairy's heart to stop her, turning her into the Black Fairy, but the Blue Fairy returns</br>
it. Then, Tiger Lily wants to give the Shears of Destiny to Fiona to cut away her powers, so she is no longer the great evil that her son would be supposed to face. Fiona insists that she needs her powers</br>
to protect her son, so she uses the shears to sever his destiny as the Savior. Fiona is then banished to the Dark Realm by the Blue Fairy, vowing to do everything in her power to one day get back to her</br>
son. Later, the Blue Fairy and Tiger Lily take the infant and return him the to his father, Malcolm. The two fairies pretend that Fiona died in an accident while protecting their son. With great</br>
bitterness, and thinking his son is responsible for the death of Fiona, Malcolm announces that he has a fitting name to bestow on the infant: Rumplestiltskin</p>

<h2>Hisory - During the Curse</h2>
<p>When the kingdom resorts to using children as soldiers in yet another ogre war, Rumplestiltskin and his son flee into the forest, only to be found and bullied by royal knights. After the knights leave,</br>
Rumplestiltskin and Baelfire are approached by a mysterious old man who offers them help in exchange for a small amount of food and company. After Rumplestiltskin explains his reason for running away, 
the old man has a better idea and steers him towards stealing a magical dagger from the Duke's castle. As holder of the dagger, Rumplestiltskin can control the Dark One, a terrifying entity with unmatched</br>
magical powers who is the most feared being in all the land. He decides to steal the dagger with the hopes of protecting Baelfire and turning the Dark One into a force of good. However, Rumplestiltskin</br>
can't see himself keeping the Dark One as a slave as he is terrified of him. Convinced he has no other choice, Rumplestiltskin sets fire to the Duke's castle and makes off with the blade. Afterwards, he</br>
meets Baelfire in the forest and sends him home. Once alone, Rumplestiltskin summons the Dark One and cowers at the being's presence. When the Dark One taunts him about Baelfire not truly being his son,</br>
Rumplestiltskin stabs the entity in a fit of blind rage. Shockingly, he discovers the Dark One is the old man who told him about the dagger. The man briefs on all the horrible deeds he was forced to do as</br>
the Dark One and states death is welcome release and ominously warns Rumplestiltskin that "magic always comes with a price". Then, Rumplestiltskin's own name replaces Zoso's on the dagger, and he gains 
the powers of the Dark One, altering his appearance in the process. Relishing over his new-found status, he returns home to humiliate and kill the knights who harassed him and his son using his dagger and</br>
strength while Baelfire looks on in terror</p>
<p>After Isaac rewrites everyone's stories in the Heroes and Villains book, Rumplestiltskin becomes a valiant knight known as the Light One, who uses his magic to save villagers from danger. He is married</br>
to Belle, and together, they have a young son. However, in this reality, Rumplestiltskin remembers trying to save his previous son, Baelfire, during the Ogre War, only to lose him. One day, he saves Henry</br>
from an ogre, before heading off to save another village. Arriving home, Rumplestiltskin finds Belle has welcomed a stranger, Isaac, into their home. While his wife goes to fetch water from the well, he</br>
detects Isaac has other reasons for coming here. Isaac mentions knowing details of Rumplestiltskin's actual life before the alternate timeline, although the Light One remembers none of this, in which he was</br>
a coward and abandoned Baelfire. He threatens to reveal all this to everyone and ruin his happiness with Belle unless Rumplestiltskin kills Henry and stops Regina from interrupting Robin Hood's wedding.</br>
Stuck in a dilemma, Rumplestiltskin talks to Belle, telling her that the kingdom is in danger and if left unchecked, it will destroy the happiness they have. He worries about making a choice that may be the</br>
wrong one, but she is certain he'll do the right thing because he's a hero. Deciding to choose self-preservation, Rumplestiltskin blocks Regina from reaching the wedding, but Emma distracts him with a duel,</br>
while the latter rushes for the church. After she is defeated, he bests Henry and prepares to deliver a killing blow, but Regina takes the hit instead. Believing his work is done, Rumplestiltskin teleports</br>
away in a glow of light. Once Henry harnesses the pen and becomes the next Author, Isaac's stories are undone and everyone returns to their old lives in Storybrooke.</p>
</br>
<h2>History - After the Curse</h2>
<p>Shortly after the purple smoke clears, Emma reunites with Mary Margaret and David after the curse has been broken. She pulls back after the tender moment and states to her allies, including Granny, Ruby,</br>
Mother Superior and the seven dwarves, have to find Mr. Gold and ask him what he did to Storybrooke by releasing the purple smoke. As they walk towards the pawn shop, her parents attempt to get Emma to</br> 
open up to them. Emma is still reeling from finding out who they are and asks for time to adjust. Suddenly, Archie rushes up to inform them that Dr. Whale is leading an angry mob to Regina's house. Prompted</br>
by Henry's concern for Regina, they make it in time to stop Dr. Whale. With her parents, they decide to place Regina in a jail cell for protection and then confront Mr. Gold for his misdeeds. Mr. Gold believes</br>
that he deserves thanks for bringing Emma to her parents, breaking the curse and saving Henry's life, which she is doubtful he has any credit in. Instead, they learn Mr. Gold released a Wraith upon town to</br>
destroy Regina. They temporarily stop the creature, but Regina has a more permanent solution by using a hat to send it away. About the time when the Wraith causes destruction in Storybrooke, Emma drives her 
car to somewhere and almost bumps into a man. At town hall, Regina's attempt at opening a vortex fails until Emma grabs her hand and unintentionally activates the hat. Emma pushes Regina out of the way when
the Wraith moves to grab her. As the Wraith falls into the vortex, Emma is drawn in, to which Mary Margaret follows through. The two women land in the Enchanted Forest and are found by Auroraand Mulan.</p>
