<h2>History - Before the Curse</h2>
<p>While Emma is still growing in her mother Snow White's womb, Snow makes a desperate wish on a blue star to have a way to give her daughter a happy ending. The Blue Fairy hears this wish and grants it</br>
by causing everyone to sing. The magic in all the songs are later imbued into Emma's heart by the Blue Fairy, who explains that she'll need the songs one day as she will fight a great battle on her own. </br>
On the day the Evil Queen's Dark Curse is cast, Snow goes into labor early and gives birth to Emma. While the plan had been to put a pregnant Snow into the magic wardrobe to ensure Emma, the prophesied</br>
Savior of the Queen's curse, would have her mother to guide her as she grew up in the Land Without Magic, Emma's parents are forced to send their daughter into the wardrobe. Emma's father Prince Charming</br>
fights his way past the Queen's knights to put her into the wardrobe, which will bring her to the Land Without Magic where she will hopefully grow up and break the curse in twenty-eight years. Prior to</br>
Emma going into the wardrobe, Pinocchio went through it at Geppetto's behest, ending up in the woods outside of Storybrooke, a town created from the curse. Once Emma arrives in the Land Without</br>
Magic, Pinocchio picks up Emma, and the two children are later placed in a foster home together. Despite that Pinocchio promised Geppetto that he'd look after Emma until she is ready to be the Savior,</br>
he abandons her for freedom, leaving her to grow up in the system alone.</p>
</br>
<h2>History - During the Curse</h2>
<p>Growing up in the foster care system, Emma moves from family to family. At one point, she is adopted and lives with a family, but is returned to the foster system at age three when that family has a</br> 
biological child of their own. In 1989, Emma and some children from her group home visit a movie theater in Minnesota to watch the Disney film, The Sword in the Stone. In the theater, Emma steals an</br>
Apollo candy bar from another person, and as she takes a seat, an usher tells her to not do "it". She begins apologizing for stealing, but he points out that he is actually referring to something else</br>
and then cautions her against doing things for the right reasons because bad things will happen. He tells her she will have the chance to pull the sword out of the stone one day, but that she must never</br>
do it. After giving her the message, he disappears. In 1990, sometime after running away from her group home, Emma begins living on the streets. One night, she rips out pages from a fairytale book and</br>
burns them in a trash can in an effort to keep warm. As she moves to tear out a page from The Ugly Ducking story, a boy, actually the older Pinocchio, stops her from destroying it. He offers her insight</br>
about all fairytales being about transformation, such as the duckling turning into a swan, but Emma believes the duckling was always a swan without knowing it. The boy explains his view of the duckling</br>
having turned into a swan with the power of belief, and that if someone believes in something hard enough, they can change their fate. He uses this to persuade Emma that being on the streets is not the</br>
fate she wants that despite running away from her previous home, it doesn't mean she won't find a good one someday. Encouraged by these words, Emma goes to the police for help, and when asked for her</br>
last name, she adopts the surname "Swan" to pay homage to the advice she got about the ugly duckling and the power to change by believing in herself.</p>
</br>
<h2>History - After the Curse</h2>
<p>Shortly after the purple smoke clears, Emma reunites with Mary Margaret and David after the curse has been broken. She pulls back after the tender moment and states to her allies, including Granny, Ruby,</br>
Mother Superior and the seven dwarves, have to find Mr. Gold and ask him what he did to Storybrooke by releasing the purple smoke. As they walk towards the pawn shop, her parents attempt to get Emma to 
open up to them. Emma is still reeling from finding out who they are and asks for time to adjust. Suddenly, Archie rushes up to inform them that Dr. Whale is leading an angry mob to Regina's house. Prompted</br>
by Henry's concern for Regina, they make it in time to stop Dr. Whale. With her parents, they decide to place Regina in a jail cell for protection and then confront Mr. Gold for his misdeeds. Mr. Gold believes</br>
that he deserves thanks for bringing Emma to her parents, breaking the curse and saving Henry's life, which she is doubtful he has any credit in. Instead, they learn Mr. Gold released a Wraith upon town to</br>
destroy Regina. They temporarily stop the creature, but Regina has a more permanent solution by using a hat to send it away. About the time when the Wraith causes destruction in Storybrooke, Emma drives 
her car to somewhere and almost bumps into a man. At town hall, Regina's attempt at opening a vortex fails until Emma grabs her hand and unintentionally activates the hat. Emma pushes Regina out of the way 
when the Wraith moves to grab her. As the Wraith falls into the vortex, Emma is drawn in, to which Mary Margaret follows through. The two women land in the Enchanted Forest and are found by Aurora</br>
and Mulan.</p>
