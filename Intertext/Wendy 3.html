<div class="leftBlock"><a href="Peter 2.html">I don't care what they say, I won't grow</br>
up if we can't have pillow fights." said</br>
Michael. "Grown-ups never have any fun"</br>
said John. "I won't grow up either - so

said Wendy</a>. She thought for a moment.</div>

<div class="rightBlock">Wait! I have an idea! she cried.</br>
If we go to <a href="Neverland.html">Neverland</a> with</br>
Peter Pan we won't grow up! Not ever."</br>
"What a wonderful dea!" said the boys.</br>
I wish Peter Pan were here," Wendy said</br>
