<h2>Neverland</h2>

<strong>Neverland</strong> is a fictional location featured in the works of J. M. Barrie and those based on</br> 
them. It is an imaginary faraway place, where Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and</br> 
other mythical creatures and beings live. Although not all people who come to Neverland</br> 
cease to age, its best known resident famously refused to grow up, and it is often used</br> 
as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), immortality, and escapism. It</br> 
was first introduced as "the Never Never Land" in the theatre play Peter Pan, or The Boy</br> 
Who Wouldn't Grow Up by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, first staged in 1904.</br>
</br>

In his 1911 novelisation Peter and Wendy, Barrie referred to "the Neverland", and its many</br> 
variations "the Neverlands". In the earliest drafts of Barrie's play, the island was</br>
called "Peter's Never Never Never Land", a name possibly influenced by "the Never Never", a</br> 
contemporary term for outback Australia. In the 1928 published version of the script, it</br> 
was shortened to "the Never Land". Neverland has been featured prominently in subsequent</br> 
works, either adapting Barrie's works or expanding upon them. These Neverlands sometimes</br> 
vary in nature from the original.</br>

</br>

</br>

<h2>Nature of Neverland</h2>

Barrie explains that the Neverlands are found in the minds of children, and that although</br> 
each is "always more or less an island", and they have a family resemblance, they are not</br> 
the same from one child to the next. For example, John Darling's had "a lagoon with</br> 
flamingos flying over it" while his little brother Michael's had "a flamingo with lagoons</br> 
flying over it". The novel further explains that the Neverlands are compact enough that</br> 
adventures are never far between. It says that a map of a child's mind would resemble a map</br> 
of Neverland, with no boundaries at all.</br>

</br>

The exact situation of Neverland is ambiguous and vague. In Barrie's original tale, the name</br> 
for the real world is the Mainland, which suggests Neverland is a small island, reached</br> 
by flight. Peter tells Wendy the way to Neverland is "second to the right, and straight</br> 
on till morning" but it is made clear "he just said anything that came into his head". In</br> 
the novel, it is stated they found the island only because it was "out looking for</br> 
them". Barrie also writes that it is near the "stars of the milky way" and it is reached</br> 
"always at the time of sunrise".</br>

</br>

Walt Disney's 1953 Peter Pan presents the possibility it is located in space, adding a "star"</br> 
to Peter's directions: "second star to the right, and straight on till morning" and</br> 
from afar, these stars depict Neverland in the distance. The 2003 film version echoes this</br> 
representation, as the Darling children are flown through the solar system to reach Neverland.</br>

</br>

In Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens a proto-version of Neverland called the birds' island is</br> 
located in the Serpentine in Kensington Gardens and reached by the baby Peter by flight</br> 
or sailing in a paper boat or a thrush's nest.</br>

</br>

The passage of time in Neverland is also ambiguous. The novel Peter and Wendy mentions that</br> 
there are many more suns and moons there than on the mainland, making time difficult to</br> 
track. One way to tell the time is to find the crocodile, and wait until the clock</br> 
inside it strikes the hour. Although widely thought of as a place where children don't</br> 
grow up, Barrie wrote that the Lost Boys eventually grew up and have to leave, and fairies</br> 
there lived typically short lifespans.</br>

</br>

In Peter Pan in Scarlet, the children get to Neverland by flying on a road called the High</br>
 Way, and the island is located in a sea known as the Sea of One Thousand Islands. Time</br> 
freezes as soon as the children arrived in Neverland.</br>

</br>

In the miniseries Neverland, it is stated that Neverland is another planet existing at the</br> 
centre of the universe, only accessible via a magic portal generated by a strange sphere,</br> 
where time has frozen due to external cosmic forces converging on the planet, preventing</br> 
anyone living there from ageing.</br>

</br>

</br>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>

<h3>Fairies</h3>

Fairies are arguably the most important magical inhabitants of the Neverland, and its</br> 
primary magic users. A property of their nature is the production and possession of fairy</br>
dust, the magic material which enables flying for all characters except Peter, who was</br> 
taught to fly by the birds (as described by Barrie in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens), and</br> 
later by the fairies in Kensington Gardens. They are allied to the Lost Boys and against</br> 
the pirates. The only-named fairy is Tinker Bell, Peter Pan's companion, whose name</br> 
alludes to her profession as a "tinker" or fixer of pots and pans. Tinker Bell is</br> 
essentially a household fairy, but far from benign. Her exotic, fiery nature, and capacity</br> 
for evil and mischief, due to fairies being too small to feel more than one type of</br> 
emotion at any one time, is reminiscent of the more hostile fairies encountered by Peter in</br> 
Kensington Gardens.</br>
</br>

In Barrie's play and novel, the roles of fairies are brief: they are allies to the Lost</br>
 Boys, the source of fairy dust and where they act as "guides" for parties travelling to and</br> 
from Neverland. They are also responsible for the collection of abandoned or lost babies</br> 
from the Mainland to the Neverland. The roles and activities of the fairies are more</br> 
elaborate in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. They occupy kingdoms in the Gardens and at</br> 
night, "mischief children who are locked in after dark" to their deaths or entertain</br> 
them before they return to their parents the following day, and they guard the paths to</br> 
a "Proto-Neverland" called the birds' island. These fairies are more regal and engage in</br> 
a variety of human activities in a magical fashion. They have courts, can grant wishes</br> 
to children and have a practical relationship with the birds, which is however</br> 
"strained by differences". They are portrayed as dangerous, whimsical and extremely clever</br> 
but quite hedonistic. After forgetting how to fly, unable to be taught by the birds,</br> 
(see birds, below), Peter is given the power to fly again by the fairies.</br>

</br>

Barrie writes that "when the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a</br> 
thousand pieces, ... and that was the beginning of fairies". and Neverland's fairies can</br> 
be killed whenever someone says they don't believe in fairies, suggesting that the</br> 
race of fairies is finite and exhaustible. When dying from Hook's poison, Tinker Bell is</br> 
saved when Peter and other children and adults across the Neverlands and Mainland call out</br> 
"I do believe in fairies, I do, I do", so their deaths are not necessarily permanent.</br> 
At the end of Barrie's novel Wendy asks Peter about Tinker Bell, whom he has forgotten</br> 
and he answers, "I expect she is no more".</br>

</br>

The Disney Fairies Peter Pan franchise has elaborated on aspects of Barrie's fairy</br> 
mythology. The "Never Fairies" (and associated sparrow men) live in Pixie Hollow, located in</br> 
the heart of Neverland. As stated in the Tinker Bell film, after the baby's first</br> 
laugh enters a flower, it breaks the flower into numerous pieces (the seeds), any piece that</br> 
can blow with the wind and survive the trip to Pixie Hollow becomes a fairy, who then</br> 
learns his/her specific talent.</br>

</br>

<h3>Birds</h3>

In the novel and the play, between the flight from the mainland (reality) and the Neverland,</br> 
they are relatively simple animals which provide entertainment, instruction and some</br> 
limited guidance to flyers. These birds are described as unable to sight its shores,</br> 
"even, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners".</br>

</br>

The Never Bird saves Peter from drowning when he is stranded on Marooners' Rock, by giving</br>
 him her nest which he uses as a sailing vessel.</br>

</br>

In Barrie's Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, birds have a far more prominent role on a</br>
 proto-Neverland called the Birds' Island. On the island, the various birds speak</br> 
bird-language, described as being related to fairy language which can be understood by young</br>
 humans, who used to be birds. The birds are responsible for bringing human babies into</br>
 the Mainland, whose human parents send folded paper boats along the serpentine "with</br> 
'boy' or 'girl' and 'thin' or 'fat' (and so on) written", indicating to the official</br> 
birds which species to send back to transform into human children, who are described as</br>
 having an "itch on their backs where their wings used to be" and that their warbles are</br> 
fairy/bird talk.</br>

</br>

<h3>Lost Boys</h3>
The Lost Boys are a tribe of "children who fall out of their prams when the nurse is not</br> 
looking", and who, having not been claimed by humans in seven days, were collected by the</br>
 fairies and flown to the Neverland. There are no "lost girls" because, as Peter</br> 
explains, girls are much too clever to fall out of their prams and be lost in this manner.</br>
 There are six Lost Boys: Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, Curly and the Twins. They are not</br> 
permitted to fly by Peter, as it is a sign of his authority and uniqueness. They live in</br>
 tree houses and caves, wear animal skins, bear spears and bows and arrows, and live for</br> 
adventure. They are a formidable fighting force despite their youth and they make war with</br> 
the pirates, although they seem to enjoy a harmonious existence with the other</br> 
inhabitants of Neverland.</br>

</br>

<h3>Pirates</h3>
The crew of the Pirate ship Jolly Roger have taken up residence off-shore, and are widely</br> 
feared throughout Neverland. How they came to be in Neverland is unclear. Their captain is</br> 
the ruthless James Hook, named after the hook in place of his right hand.</br>

</br>

<h3>"Redskins"</h3>
There is a tribe of wigwam-dwelling Native Americans who live on the island, referred to by</br> 
Barrie as "Redskins" or the Piccaninny tribe. Their chief is Great Big Little Panther,</br> 
whose daughter Tiger Lily has a crush on Peter Pan. The Piccaninny tribe are known to</br>
make ferocious and deadly war against Captain Hook and his pirates, but their connection</br> 
with the Lost Boys is more lighthearted. For "many moons" the two groups have captured</br> 
each other, only to promptly release the captives, as though it were a game.</br>

</br>

<h3>Mermaids</h3>

Mermaids live in the lagoon. They enjoy the company of Peter Pan but keep their distance</br> 
from everyone else on the island, including the fairies. They are not sociable creatures</br> 
and do not speak nor interact with outsiders. They are malevolent, hedonistic and</br> 
frivolous; yet they sing and play "mermaid games" in which they "rise to the surface in</br> 
extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles", "made in rainbow water". They also "love</br>
to bask out on Marooners' Rock, combing their hair in a lazy way". At first glance,</br> 
Wendy is enchanted by their beauty, but finds them vain and irritating, as they would</br> 
"splash her with their tails, not accidentally, but intentionally" when she attempted to</br> 
steal a closer look. Their homes are "coral caves underneath the waves" to which they</br> 
retire at sunset and rising tide, as well as in anticipation of storms. When one mermaid</br> 
tries to pull Wendy into the water and drown her, Peter intervenes and hisses – rather than</br> 
crows – at them and they quickly dive into the water and disappear. Barrie describes</br> 
the mermaids' "haunting" transformation at the "turn of the moon" while "uttering</br> 
strange wailing cries" at night as the lagoon becomes a very "dangerous place for mortals".</br>
The Mermaids' Lagoon is a favourite "adventure" for the children, and where they take</br> 
their "midday meal". Peter gives Wendy one of the mermaid's combs as a gift.</br>

</br>

The 2003 film Peter Pan briefly describes mermaids as different from those in traditional</br>
 story books, but as "dark creatures in touch with all things mysterious", and who will</br> 
drown humans who get too close, but do not harm Peter who seems to be the only one who can</br> 
speak the mermaid's language. They always seem to know Hook's whereabouts on the island</br> 
at any given time and tell Peter.</br>

</br>

<h2>Animal kingdom</h2>
Animals (referred to as "beasts") live throughout Neverland, such as Bears, Tigers, Lions,</br> 
Wolves, Flamingoes and Crocodiles. In Barrie's original novel, these "beasts" hunt the</br> 
Piccaninny tribe, who hunt the Pirates, who are themselves hunting the Lost Boys, who in</br> 
turn hunt the beasts, creating a chain of prey and murder in the Neverland that only</br> 
ends when one party stops or slows down, or when Peter redirects the Lost Boys to other</br>
 tasks and activities. Like all the agencies of the Neverland, the animals do not need to</br> 
eat, nor are they eaten when killed, nor do they reproduce (as they enjoy the same</br> 
immortality as all other inhabitants), so their presence is a paradox. There are also a</br> 
variety of birds, whose societies are present in the proto-Neverland described in Barrie's</br>
 Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens.</br>

</br>

<h2>Other residents</h2>

Other inhabitants of Neverland are suggested by Barrie in his original novel, such as a</br> 
"small old lady with a hooked nose", "gnomes who are mostly tailors", and princes "with six</br>
 elder brothers" – reminiscent of European fairy tales. There are also some briefly</br> 
described locations without inhabitants, but the narrator hints at their former presence,</br> 
such as a "hut fast going to decay".</br>
