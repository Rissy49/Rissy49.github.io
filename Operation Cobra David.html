<h2>History - Before the Curse</h2>
<p>Prince Charming is born with the name David, to a poor peasant family, with his twin brother James. One night, the twins are very sick and their father Robert tries to buy some medicine for them.</br> 
Robert returns home empty-handed as he could not afford it, to which a wizard named Rumplestiltskin offers to pay them handsomely if he gives him one of the twins for a barren king and queen to</br>
raise as their heir. Ruth, the twins' mother, doesn't want the deal, but Robert accepts because he knows they cannot manage the farm and keep two young children fed and healthy throughout the harsh</br>
winter. When the parents cannot decide which child to forfeit, Rumplestiltskin has Robert toss a coin to determine which boy he will take. Upon the coin landing on tails, Rumplestiltskin takes away</br>
James while David is left behind to be raised by his birth parents</p>
</br>
<h2>Hisory - During the Curse</h2>
<p>After Isaac rewrites everyone's stories in the Heroes and Villains book, Prince Charming becomes Queen Snow White's henchman, after she ripped out his heart and forced him to be a replacement for</br>
her true love, James, who was also his twin brother. One day, her underlings, the seven dwarves, capture Isaac, who they suspect is a supporter of Regina as Queen. When presented with proof of his</br>
treachery, Snow White speaks into Prince Charming's heart, ordering him into the throne room, so he can execute Isaac. Before Prince Charming can sever the man's head, Isaac saves himself by</br>
revealing his knowledge about the Queen hating her stepdaughter Regina for causing James' death. He also claims Regina is conspiring with a boy, Henry, to dethrone her. Learning from him that Regina</br>
will be robbing from a royal carriage later in the day, Snow White surprises her. The Queen moves to rip out her heart, but Prince Charming convinces her to question Regina about the boy's location.</br>
When Regina hesitates in answering, Snow White prepares to throw a fireball, before Robin Hood distracts her with a loosed arrow and escapes with the thief. Discovering her prisoner Emma has escaped,</br>
Snow White tracks her down with Lily's help. Emma tries to convince the Queen and Prince Charming that they are her parents and the hope they instilled in her, which only serves to make the Queen</br>
command her Black Knights to kill her. To ensure Emma protects Henry, Hook stays behind to fight, gaining the upper hand against Prince Charming. When Hook threatens to do the same to the Queen, Prince</br>
Charming kills him, as Emma and Henry are forced to run. Once Henry harnesses the pen and becomes the next Author, Isaac's stories are undone and everyone returns to their old lives in Storybrooke.</p>
</br>
<h2>History - After the Curse</h2>
<p>Shortly after the purple smoke clears, Emma reunites with Mary Margaret and David after the curse has been broken. She pulls back after the tender moment and states to her allies, including Granny, Ruby,</br>
Mother Superior and the seven dwarves, have to find Mr. Gold and ask him what he did to Storybrooke by releasing the purple smoke. As they walk towards the pawn shop, her parents attempt to get Emma to</br> 
open up to them. Emma is still reeling from finding out who they are and asks for time to adjust. Suddenly, Archie rushes up to inform them that Dr. Whale is leading an angry mob to Regina's house. Prompted</br>
by Henry's concern for Regina, they make it in time to stop Dr. Whale. With her parents, they decide to place Regina in a jail cell for protection and then confront Mr. Gold for his misdeeds. Mr. Gold believes</br>
that he deserves thanks for bringing Emma to her parents, breaking the curse and saving Henry's life, which she is doubtful he has any credit in. Instead, they learn Mr. Gold released a Wraith upon town to</br>
destroy Regina. They temporarily stop the creature, but Regina has a more permanent solution by using a hat to send it away. About the time when the Wraith causes destruction in Storybrooke, Emma drives her 
car to somewhere and almost bumps into a man. At town hall, Regina's attempt at opening a vortex fails until Emma grabs her hand and unintentionally activates the hat. Emma pushes Regina out of the way when
the Wraith moves to grab her. As the Wraith falls into the vortex, Emma is drawn in, to which Mary Margaret follows through. The two women land in the Enchanted Forest and are found by Auroraand Mulan.</p>
