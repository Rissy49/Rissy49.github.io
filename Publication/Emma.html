The daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming,<br>
an ex-bail bonds collector, town sheriff of<br>
Storybrooke and Henry Mills' biological mother.<br>
Morrison described her character at the beginning of<br>
the first season as "broken, damaged and worldly".<br>
During the fourth season finale, "Operation<br>
Mongoose", Emma absorbs the power of the Dark One<br>
into herself to save Storybrooke.[5] In order to<br> successfully create a dark version of Emma,<br> Morrison explained that "In order to build Dark<br> Emma, I've been doing a bunch of research there<br> with some of their mythology books and old fairy tale<br> books and just looking back through the history of<br> swans and the etymology of 'Swan'" and explained<br> that Emma's rate of evolution "challenged [her] on a<br> daily basis".Emma became the primary antagonist<br> 
of the fifth season's first half, until the end of the<br> season's eighth episode when her real plans are<br> revealed.<b>
<br>
Morrison's portrayal of Emma has received praise,<br> with some reviewers noting a feminist twist in the<br> depiction of fairy tales and a strong female lead. She<br> is loosely based on the title character of the fairy tale<br>
 "The Ugly Duckling", a swan which was lost and<br>
 raised by ducks, before finding its birth family and<br> recognizing its true nature, while her Dark One side is<br> 
 loosely based on Odile the Black Swan from the<br> ballet "Swan Lake". It is revealed in the Season 6<br> episode "Tougher Than the Rest" that she chose the<br> last name Swan when she was young after a friend<br> mentioned that story.</p></div>
