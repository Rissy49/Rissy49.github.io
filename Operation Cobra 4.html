Rumpelstiltskin responds, "Oh, so worried, so so worried.
</br>

Like <a href="Operation Cobra Snow.html">Snow</a>! and her lovely new husband!
</br>

They paid me a visit... they were very anxious...About you and the curse."
</br>

The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> responds, "What did you tell them?"
</br>

<a href="Operation Cobra Rumpelstiltskin.html">Rumpelstiltskin</a> respons, "The truth! Nothing can stop the darkness... except ofcourse their unborn child."
</br>

He continues and says," You see, no matter how powerful, all curses can be broken!

</br>
There child is the key... Of course the curse has to be inactive first".

</br>
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> says, "Tell me what I did wrong."
</br>

<a href="Operation Cobra Rumpelstiltskin.html">Rumpelstiltskin</a> says, "For that... there's a price."
</br>


The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> says, "What do you want?"
<a href="Operation Coba Rumpelstiltskin.html">
</br>
Rumpelstiltskin</a> says, "Simple...in this new land. I want comfort... I want a good life."

</br>
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> responds, "Fine!, you'll have an estate, be rich."

</br>
<a href="Operation Cobra Rumpelstiltskin.html">Rumplestiltskin</a> quickly responds, "I wasn't finished! There's more!
"
</br>
Then the <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> quickly respons, "There's always is with you.
"
</br>
<a href="Operation Cobra Rumpelstiltskin.html">Rumpelstiltskin</a> continues and says, "In this new land, should I ever come to you for any reason, 
</br>
you must feed my every request.
</br>
You must do what ever I say, so long as I say please! *ha!*
</br>
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> reponds, "You do realize that should I succeed, you wont remember any of this.
</br>

<a href="Operation Cobra Rumpelstiltskin.html">Rumpelstiltksin</a> responds, "Oh, wahts the harm?"
</br>
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> then says, "deal. What must I do to enact this curse?"
</br>

</br>
The <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> continues and says, "I sacrificed my prize steed."

</br>
Then <a href="Operation Cobra Rumpelstiltskin.html">Rumpelstiltskin</a> grabs her neck through the cell and says, "A horse!?
</br>

This is the curse that, end all curses. YOU think a horse is gonna do!?
</br>
Great power requires great sacrifice... the heart you need must come from something far more precious."

</br>
Then <a href="Operation Cobra Rumpelstiltskin.html">Rumpelstiltskin</a> says, "Hmm, is there no one else you truely love???
</br>

This curse isn't going to be easy. 
</br>

Vengence never is deary. You have to ask yourself a simple question.
</br>

How far are you willing to go?"
Then the <a href="Operation Cobra Regina.html">Evil Queen</a> says, "as far as it takes."
